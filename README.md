# Glaucoma-Detection
Glaucoma Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks ðŸ‘‡
## Abstract
<p align="justify">
  Glaucoma is a chronic and irreversible eye disease, which leads to 
deterioration in vision and quality of life. we develop a Deep Learning (DL) 
with convolutional neural network for automated glaucoma diagnosis. Deep 
learning systems, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can infer a 
hierarchical representation of images to discriminate between glaucoma and 
non-glaucoma patterns for diagnostic decisions. The model is trained with 
the ROI of RIGA, DRISHTI-GS1 dataset. The Network architecture used 
gives great accuracy. A graphical user interface is used to diagnose the 
condition of test images and give a graphical analysis of the patients.

## Project Description ðŸ“š
 - Glaucoma is one of the most hazardous ocular diseases.
     - <p align="justify">
           Our Goal is to enhance the existing system with more accurate result. With the implantation of TensorFlow Framework and Keras model for deep learning and training the              model, the level of precision of the Glaucoma detection has unavoidably improved. When an image is uploaded into the system, it is compared to the model that has                  already been trained and then processed. <a href="http://ijsart.com/Home/IssueDetail?id=48809">Click Here</a> To Read More info in our journal Page.
