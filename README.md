# Glaucoma-Detection
Glaucoma Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks ðŸ‘‡
## Abstract
<p align="justify">
  Glaucoma is a chronic and irreversible eye disease, which leads to 
deterioration in vision and quality of life. we develop a Deep Learning (DL) 
with convolutional neural network for automated glaucoma diagnosis. Deep 
learning systems, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can infer a 
hierarchical representation of images to discriminate between glaucoma and 
non-glaucoma patterns for diagnostic decisions. The model is trained with 
the ROI of RIGA, DRISHTI-GS1 dataset. The Network architecture used 
gives great accuracy. A graphical user interface is used to diagnose the 
condition of test images and give a graphical analysis of the patients.
